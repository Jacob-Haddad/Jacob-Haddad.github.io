    <p>My story with the Tristero is one of confusion, coincidence, and conspiracy. I was doing research at my local library for my college literature class. I picked out an estranged book at the end of the section called <i>The Courier's Tragedy</i>. The book was not very long, but it was able to get so much across within the ten short pages it takes up that it was an easy pick for me. As I read through it and as I became more and more entranced in the twists and turns, the whole thing started to feel weirdly familiar, especially the depictions of how the people are murdered in this book, which involves their bones being thrown into a lake. This would be nothing more than a coincidence until I flipped to the last page, and a small piece of paper fell out with a strange symbol written on it. It was a trumpet shaped drawing written on a piece of ripped paper.

      <img src="IMG_0450.jpg" alt="trumpet" style="float:center;width:650px;height:400px;">
    <p> Normally I would not have payed this any attention, but there was also a part at the end of the book that was scribbled out and written over. All of these things made me even more curious about what exactly this image means and why this part of the book was scribbled out the way it was. So I did some more digging, and through my research I found alot of information about the play. The first thing I found was a report of some Wells Fargo employees who were massacred by a group of bandits in 1853. This is eerily echoed in the play, with a very similar event happening. This only grew my interest and fascination with this story even more. I continued my search until I found a group of people online who were also interested in unraveling this. It was here where I found the name behind alot of what has been happening: <b>TRIESTRO</b>. This online group helped me find out what was originally said at the end of <i> The Courier's Tragedy </i>, which states "No hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, who's once been set his tryst with Trystero". What accompanied this text you may ask? Well it was a drawing of the same trumpet that was hidden away in my book. Below are picture of all my findings so far, so look for yourself.

      <p> You might be asking: "What is the Tristero anyways"? The Tristero originated in the sixteenth century when Hernando Joaquin de Tristero y Calavera, who claims to be the heir to the Thurn and Taxis Postal System, which was currently in charge of almost all of the mail at that point in time. Hernado is declined of this "right", so he begins an attack against the current rulers of the mail system, and eventually sets up his own rival mail service. This organization runs until the French Revolution comes around and causes the Tristero to fall apart. A lot of people think this is where the organization ends, but as we have shown this is not the case. I am saying that the remaining members fled Europe and came to the US, in which they stared Tristero again as a way of counteracting the U.S governments monopoly on the mail system. This is where the Wells Fargo employees (or Pony Express riders) being attacked falls into play, as it is only said to be carried out by "people in black". The evidence gathered here is a way of cataloging and adding onto the ongoing story of the Tristero.
      </p>
      
      <p> If <b>you</b> have any information about the Triestro or may have a lead for us, please contact me so we can get to the bottom of this. Below is the pictures and proof collected so far, which includes the symbol, the original ending to <i> The Courier's Tragedy </i> and other pieces of info. This company is still out there, and we will stop at nothing to uncover it.
