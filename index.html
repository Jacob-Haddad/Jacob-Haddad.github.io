          <h2>What is AI?</h2>
          <p>AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is defined by Webster as "The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior". Think of a computer being able to think, act, and make decisions without human interaction. Sounds cool right? Or maybe you're on the other side of the argument; you think AI is dangerous, or might even destroy humaninty! To get a better idea on where you stand, take the survey below. </p>

		   <h2>Healthcare and Medical Advantages</h2>
		<p>The application of AI in everyday life is endless, but one of the biggest places people point to when talking about the usefulness of AI is the medical field.
		  Artificial Intelligence could be used to store, organize and retrieve the information on patients and their conditions. 
		  In medical diagnosis we can create programs that simulate expert human reasoning.  Artificial intelligence could make the work of doctors easier and faster as electronic health records are used. Whether the benefits of AI in medicine are apparent or not, most medical corporations are already on board. Below is a graph that shows an estimated 40% increase in market interest for AI systems in the medical field. 
		  This raises the current percent from 40% to 80% interest.</p>

		   <h2>Buisness and the Stock Market</h2>
		<p>Another field that AI has or can vastly improve is Finance, including algorithmic trading and data mining. Algorithmic trading is the process of using AI systems to make trading decisions at rates much faster than any human could do.
		In the span of a single minute, an AI system could process the information of over hundreds if not thousands of trades and determine the best outcome.
		On the other side is data mining, which is the process of extracting data from large sets of patterns.
		Data mining for business applications can be integrated into a complex modeling and decision-making processes. 
		When it comes to discovering data from patterns and other repetitive processes, AI reigns supreme.</p>

		<p>AI can help peoples everyday lives in more ways then most people realise. 
This includes anything from helping companies sort files, to helping you get directions to the nearest bathroom. AI has already been incorporated into alot of different things, but none of them have been fully free thinking or acting.
		  AI has been growing in popularity. AI is continuting to grow and expand and people are taking notice. Below is a graph for how much people have been googling and researching Artificial Intelligence over the last five years.

		   <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
		  
		  <p>Artificial intelligence has been applied in different areas, and millions of people would benefit from that. 
	However, Artificial intelligence may also be used to steal our private information and launch large scale network attacks by attackers. 
			  There are different types of security problems of AI including security threats of technology abuse, security problem induced by technical defects and self-aware intelligence evoked security problems.
			  The worst AI security concern is mainly the possibility that artificial intelligence develops into strong AI stage, when robots or other artificial intelligence products can self-evolve and may develop self-awareness, thus bringing about serious threat to human existence.
			  If unmanned vehicles, robots and other artificial intelligence products are controlled through an illegal way, these AI systems may do something harmful to people in control of criminals.

		   <h2>Ethics</h2>
		  
		  <p>As mentioned above, the biggest fear of AI systems is the threat they can bring to human existence. 
			  Ethics is a concern with the moral behavior of the machine which is designed and used for many purposes.
		 Even when we are using the services like Facebook and Google for finding what we need, artificial intelligence is used.
			  The ethical issues arise as we start to give more power and control to AI robots, and this is where the idea of developing rules and guidelines for AI comes into play. 
			  Artificial intelligence robots must learn rules before making decisions. 
			  If the design of intelligent agent is not integrated with the human constraints, it is likely to follow a different logic with human behavior and lead to terrible consequences. 
			  A great example of a set of ruels is Isaac Asimovs rules of robotics listed below.
		  </p>
		  <h2>1.A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</h2>
		  <h2>2.A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. </h2>
		  <h2>3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</h2>

		   <h2>Living in a world of AI</h2>
		  
		  <p>One of the biggest problems when it comes to AI is the more long term affects it can have. 
		  What would be the status of humanity in a world dominated by AI? 
			  What type of rights would they recieve?
		  How would AI and Humans live together? 
		  These are generally problems people don't think about when it comes to AI, because it is at such a premature age right now that its hard to imagine something like that happening.
		  These problems are very real and we need to make them more widely known before discussing limiting AI or not limiting AI.</p>

          <h2>Why so controversial?</h2>
          <p>Whether you are more pro or con AI, one thing you can't deny is that it is controversial. 
		  Other forms of technology have been evolving and taking over aspects of our lives for such a long time now, AI is really the only type that is being restricted. 
		  To me, this is because of how by giving AI the power to think and make decisions without our involvement, we feel like we are losing control over it.
		  Human beings do not like giving up control, its hardwired into us. 
		  This makes the idea of AI that works independently of us a scary thought to a lot of us. </p>

			  Should AI be restricted and held back, or allowed to evolve and live freely? 
			  Maybe you're in the middle like me, maybe you think that there is no perfect answer and the closest we can have is one that sits in the middle. 
			  No matter what you think, you can't deny the power of AI and how AI can affect us. 
			  Maybe your opinion even changed completely.
