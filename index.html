    <p> My story with the Tristero is one of confusion and coincidence. I was doing research at my local library for my high school literature class. I picked out an estranged book at the end of the section called <i>The Courier's Tragedy</i>. 
        The book was not very long, but it was able to get so much across within the ten short pages it takes up that it was an easy pick for me. As I read through it and as I became more and more entranced in the twists and turns, the whole thing started to feel weirdly familiar, 
        especially the depictions of how the people are murdered in this book, which involves their bones being thrown into a lake. This would be nothing more than a coincidence until I flipped to the last page, and a small piece of paper fell out with a strange symbol written on it.   
      
      </p>
    <p>Normally I would not have payed this any attention, but there was also a part at the end of the book that was scribbled out and written over. All of these things made me even more curious about what exactly this image means and why this part of the book was scribbled out the way it was. So I did some more digging, and through my research I found alot of information about the play and how it echos alot of events in real life. 
      The first thing I found was a report of some Wells Fargo employees who were massacred by a group of bandits in 1853. This is eerily echoed in the play, with a very similar even happening. This only grew my interest and facsination with this story even higher. I continued my search till I found a group of people online who were also interested in unraveling this. It was here where I found the name behind alot of what has been happening: <b>TRIESTRO.</b>
      This group helped me find out what was originally said at the end of <i>The Courier's Tragedy</i>, which states "No hallowed skein of stars can ward, I trow, who's once been set his tryst with Trystero". What accompanied this text you may ask? Well it was a drawing of the same trumpet that was hidden away in my book. Below are picture of all my findings so far, so look for yourself.
